# OSE data science replication project | Gözde Özden

This is the final project of the Microeconometrics course in Summersemester 2021 by Gözde Özden.

## Project overview

This project contains my replication of the results from the following paper:

> [Lee, D. S., Moretti, E., & Butler, M. J. (2004). Do voters affect or elect policies? Evidence from the US House. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119(3), 807-859.](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/119/3/807/1938834?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

There are two main theories to understand whether voters affect or elect policies : convergence theory and divergence theory. Lee et al. (2004) use Regression Discontiunity Design and voting record data from the U. S. House (1946 –1995) to investigate which different view is more applicable and relevant. In addition to following selected key results of the paper through my replication project, I add extension part to deepen the research. 

The replication paper can be found in the project.ipynb, which also can be accessed using nbviewer and binder. I highly recommend to use these badges in the case of displaying and latex rendering issues.

## Reproducibility

I set up Continuous Integration Workflow and share an environment.yml file to ensure full reproducibility of my project.

## Acknowledgement

I want to thank Lee, Butler and Moretti. This replication project could only be conducted because they provide their data and their STATA codes for most of the results.
